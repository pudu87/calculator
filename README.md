# calculator

Some notes on using this calculator:

- If you try to divide by zero or manage to overflow the result display, you will get an 'error'-message. No result will be calculated in both cases.
- If you manage to overflow the operation display, no additional characters can be added or operations can be performed. You will still be able to use the 'backspace' or 'clear' button though.
- It is possible to control the calculator with the keypad. I don't have one of those big keyboards myself, so here I will list some of the less obvious keys you should use: add (a), subtract (s), multiply (m), divide (d), clear (c), change sign (-), operate (enter).
